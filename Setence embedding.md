[WhiteningBERT: An Easy Unsupervised Sentence Embedding Approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.01767.pdf)   
## conclusion:
* averaging all tokens is better than [CLS]
* combinging both top and bottom layers is better thann top layer(last hidden layer) only
* whitening-based vector normalization will boost performance
